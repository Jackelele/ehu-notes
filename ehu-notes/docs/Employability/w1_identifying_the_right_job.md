# WEEK 1 - IDENTIFYING THE RIGHT JOB, FOR YOU!

## Searching for Jobs
* Which of the thousands of job sites should I use?
* What papers should I buy to read the advertised jobs in?
* Which agency should I sign up to?
    * Should I sign up to any?

## Selling yourself!

The type of profile you want to market yourself digitally:
* Your portfolio website (who you are and examples of what you have done)
* Your Twitter profile (are you active in your field, including following, commenting and posting)
* Your LinkedIn Profile (does it show you as interested in the industry you want to enter?)

You may not have these at the moment, but now is the time to start putting these together and start being active in the industry, even if it is only following and reading on twitter.
* 
* Knowing who are the evangelists in your industry will give you the edge in interviews.
* Knowing these peoples ideas, and contributions to the industry will be even better.
* Having examples that people can see of where you have tried out the ideas is by far the best, this then means that you can talk about the inspiring people in the industry as well as their novel ideas/works and you can discuss the good and bad things you discovered whilst trying them out.

### Important Notes for LinkedIn Profile

1. Who you are linked to is important. (Especially thier roles) - Do not link to all your friends or class mates.
2. Do not link to just anyone in the industry. Only link to those you know or you have at least spoken to (use the meetups to advance this).
3. Follow organisations (They regularly post company and industry updates as well as jobs. They can also see you are following them, which could help when it comes to applying for a job).

## Identifying the evidence

### How do you identify the evidence you want to present for certain skills?
The right amount is variable, depending on the weight you or the job spec places on each skill. 

It also depends on your evidence you actually have. You need to try and make sure there is a nice spread of: evidence from your degree, and outside of your degree.

1. Start by listing all of the skills asked for, and then sort them into essential and non-essential. You could do this in a spreadsheet or you can do it on paper or even with a load of post-it notes.

2. Next think about any and every piece of evidence you have for that skill and list them next to the skill.

3. Once you have something against all of the skills, it is time to assess which evidence you think shows you in the best light for this job. The evidence may be different for each and every application you make!

### How can you make sure you meet all of the skills?
* (if there is time before the job closes) Go out of your way and get the skill quick, maybe by working on some open source project (GitHub), undertaking a Lynda.com course (you get free access as a EHU student)
* Decide if the skill is essential for the job or not and if not leave it out

### How confident are you in the evidence you have?
Using LinkedIn can be a way to not have too. Instead we can get others to do it for us. You can add skills and ask others to rate you or you can ask a select few people to write a recommendation for you about some specific skill(s).

### Doing it yourself
There are ways to improve our confidence in our own skills and communicate these well. To do this we need to look at our skills in terms of habits.

* To start with you need to stop thinking in terms "I can" or "I cannot" and also in terms of "bad", "ok" and "good" and instead start to think of your skills in terms of numbers.
* When we start to see our skills and personality as habits we can rate them on a simple Likert scale. We can then also see what we need to improve on. And we can also then judge our confidence in that skill.
    * E.g. planning habits: long-term and short-term 1 2 3 4 5
* One way to look at your technical skills can be by turning them into a habit and answering a question like:
    * E.g. I code for an hour every day? 1 2 3 4 5
* If you code for hours every day you can be pretty sure you are confident at doing the skill but also pretty confident that you will have some evidence to show. 
* Whereas if you only code in class and you class is once a week your confidence is not going to be higher than say a 1 or 2 and your evidence is only going to be class tasks.

### Split your Want's and your Need's
The need is important so that it drives you to achieve! We all go through life saying we don't have time for this or for that and that I am bad at something and we look to blame others for our own shortcomings.

The fact of the matter is that there is NEVER a right time to do pretty much anything, we are great procrastinators (a person who delays or puts things off — like work, chores, or other actions — that should be done in a timely manner). Until we truly Need something. Then we instinctively change and get switched on to the task.

* To get you started. start small. If you want to be a coder, start by blocking off an hour a day and planning what you want to code. if you do not know what to code, search for coding Katas on the internet and start there. then start and stick to the hour a day. You will soon grow. then identify some other good habits and start to add those in.
