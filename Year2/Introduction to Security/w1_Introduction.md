# Introduction

## Terminology

* **Asset:** is anything that has value
* **Threat:** is a type of action that has potential to cause harm
* **Threat Agent:** is a person or element that has the power to carry out the threat
* **Vulnerability:** is a flaw or weakness that allows a threat agent to bypass security
* **Exploit:** is the act of exploiting the security weakness 


## Security Attacks, Mechanisms & Services

* **Security Attack:** Any action that compromises the security of information
* **Security Mechanism:** A process / device that is designed to detect, prevent or recover from a security attack.
* **Security Service:** A service intended to counter security attacks, typically by implementing one or more mechanisms.


### Why the increasing number of attacks?
* Increased connectivity
* Many valuable assets online
* Sophisticated attack tools and strategies available
* Faster detection of Vulnerabilities
* Delays in security updates
* User Confusion - Users are called upon to make difficult security decisions with little or no guidance      

### Why should we care?

* Reputation
* Financial Loss
* Customer Loyalty
* Loss of Valuable Data 
* Legal issues – Data Protection Regulations

According to the Cyber Security breaches survey, published by the Department for Culture Media & Sport:

* 46% of all UK businesses identified at least one cyber security breach or attack in the last 12 months. 
* This rises to two-thirds among medium firms (66%) and large firms (68%).

## Computer Security vs Information Security

* Often used interchangeably
* Computer security (aka IT security) is mostly concerned with information in ‘digital form’ stored on computers.
* Information security is concerned with information in any form it may take: electronic, print, etc. 

### Difference

* Information can be stolen - but you still have it.
* Confidential information may be copied and sold - but the theft might not be detected.
* The criminals may be on the other side of the world.

Information is stored on computer hardware, maniuplated by software, transimitted by comunication, used by people and controlled by policies.


## The Internet
* The Internet brings millions of computer networks into communication with each other—many of them unsecured  

* Ability to secure a computer’s data influenced by the security of every computer to which it is connected
